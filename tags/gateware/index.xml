      <description>A gateware CPU The Boneless-CPU is a soft CPU written in nmigen by Whitequark.
It is a 16bit Von Neumann machine with a completely flat memory space , registers and all. The gateway is nice and compact and fits into about 500 LUTS plus memory. This makes it perfect for control plane processor and can run up to about 50 MHz so it can run the same clock as the rest of the design.</description>

      <description>FPGA fun I recently aquired a TinyFpgaBX and have been investigating programming RTL.
After doing regular programming , thinking in gateware is a brain melter.
TinyFPGA-BX Is a nifty little breadboard friendly board (website), this board has been designed by Luke Valenty and is a great little board to get started with FPGA programming.
Building reconfigurable logic Historically the tooling needed to program FPGA has been vendor specific, the software has been huge, buggy, not portable and a usually windows only.</description>
